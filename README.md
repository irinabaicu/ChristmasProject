# ChristmasProject
This code helps Santa and his workers sort through the kid's letters and deliver the gifts they deserve.
The main part of the code contains the classes that are all derived fom SantaCrew which determines the child 
classes to override the methods print() and work() which are called in main.
The main does the folowing:
-prints what the elves have distributed to each child based on some condition (naughty or nice / budget )
-prints how many wraps of each color trolls need to wrap the gifts for the children
-prints the budget allocated for candies and coals by Mrs Santa
-prints the distance in km that Santa has to travel in order to deliver every gift
-prints the order of towns Santa has to visit
-a message from Mrs Santa about Santa's town list.
